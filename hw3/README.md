We have included copies of our templated code for BNode, which is used for BinarySearchTree, and RBNode, which is used for RedBlackTree. They are all found in their corresponding .h files. main.cpp contains all testing and verification code. If compiled and run, you can use a nice interface to either run the provided test cases, or interactively test the tree by adding and removing nodes from it.
